Data folder:

•	Matlab files are rate maps of cells used to generate correlation matrices for the cue-conflict and population vector correlations for the two shape and the two room experiments.  Each row is a cell.

•	CSV files are the calculated correlation differences at each tetrode location for the cue-conflict (_tetall.csv), for the two-shape (_shape.cvs), and for the two-room (_room.csv) for each animal group.  


Code folder:

•	lme_template.Rmd : for linear mixed effects model in R (use with CSV files)

•	pv_corr.m : for population vector correlations

•	shift_corr_matrix : for correlation matrices
